# 🔮 Next Word Prediction using LSTM in Python

This project is an LSTM-based **Next Word Predictor** trained on *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* using deep learning and NLP techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Trained on real text corpus (`Project Gutenberg`)
- Uses LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Predicts top next word suggestions for any sentence
- Clean, well-commented code for learning

## 💡 Sample Prediction

```python
Prompt: "holmes looked at the"
Predicted Next Words: ['of', 'and', 'to', 'i', 'which']
